# SnakesandLadders
 The goal of this program was to simulate a snakes and ladders board game. Two to four users can play the game, and the game rolls the dice to determine the order in which the 
 players will play. The program has an orderedPlayers recursive method which can break any amount of ties the players have when trying to determine the playing order. This was done as an assignment for one of my classes where we were specifically asked NOT TO use ArrayLists, which made coding the recursive method a little bit more difficult. Once the game begins, the program runs until one of the players lands on 100. If a player lands on a snake they slide down to the bottom of the snake and if the player lands on a ladder they move up the ladder. This program is written in Java on the eclipse platform.
